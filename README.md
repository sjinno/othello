# Othello

![Build](https://github.com/sjinno/othello/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

## Todo:

- [x] Get input and process it with proper error handling.
- [x] Handle passes.
- [x] Automatically skip one's turn when there are no available moves.
- [x] Show score at the end of game.
- [x] Message when player passes, resigns, or wins.
- [x] Automatically end game when none of the players have available moves.
- [x] Probably handle input better... :)
